This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML error related to accessing DOM elements before they are fully rendered. The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version. The error arises from attempting to manipulate a DOM element's `innerHTML` property before the element is added to the Document Object Model (DOM). This typically happens when the script attempting to access the element is executed before the HTML parser has completed processing the relevant part of the document. The solution involves ensuring that the script runs after the DOM is ready, using an event listener or placing the script at the end of the body.
